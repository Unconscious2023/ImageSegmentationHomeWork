The origin code uses a light CNN as an encoder, and the author uses a ResNet23 to replace it.

The origin code is download from https://github.com/Jack-Cherish/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Pytorch-Seg/lesson-2

The output images are saved in the following directories:

​ResNet23 results:​​ data/test/result

​Original CNN results:​​ data/test/result_primitivation

​Merged results:​​ data/test
